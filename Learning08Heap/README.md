- like queue in which each element also has "priority" associated with it

- heap is not exactly the same as priority queue.  PQ is abstract data type, heap is DS.  Heap implements priority queue

- PQ implemented with array or linked list has O(N) complexity.  Heap impl has O(log N)

## definition heap

- is complete bin tree
- each node greater or less than child nodes, so sorted.
- insertion log N
- deletion log N
- getMin/Max O(1)
