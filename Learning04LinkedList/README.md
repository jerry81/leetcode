# intro

- another Data struct, linked list
- similar to array, linear DS
- objects linked with ref field
- 2 types
  - singly and doubly linked

# singly linked list

## intro

- each node contains value and ref to next
- last node points to None
- impl in C++ with struct
- in java with class

- unlike arrays, not able to access random element in constant time.  takes O(N) time to visit element by index
- if bad perf, why useful then?
  - insert and delete operations better
