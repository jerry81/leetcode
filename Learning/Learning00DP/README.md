# what is DP

- 2 characteristics
  - overlapping subproblems
  - optimal substructure - "optimal solution" formed from "optimal solutions" to overlapping subproblems 
- easiest to use DP: Fib 

# top down vs bottom up 

- bottom-up aka tabulation 
- done with iteration 
- starts with base cases 
- fib (0) and fib(1) stored 

- top down aka memoization 
- must be done with recursion 

- buttom up usually faster
- top down easier to write 

- DP useful for: min/max problems 
  - counting problems 
  - traversal problems
