# Intro

first place new LCers should go

# solving first problem 

- leet code's core is solving problems 

- start with most beginner-friendly tree problem and use visualizer 

- problem list: 
  - 1480: running sum of 1D array
    - solve by oneself and come back and watch video 

# where to start
- depends on engineer.
- end goal?  Data structures?  competetive programming?  problem solving?
- DS and algorithms comfortable with already?
- much content on leetcode based on Data Structures and algorithms (DSA)
- other directions: high-level design, DB, concurrency 
- can do fast track if having interview soon
- db: use SQL explore card and DB problem set 
- beginner track for complete newbies on first PL
- Intermediate track if comfortable with DSA, recursion, trees, dynamic programming, DFS, BFS, union-find?, shortest paths, topological 

# explore card track
- start with array 101
- linked list
- array and string
- binary tree (done)
- recursion 1
- hash table
- queue & stack

# tips
- consistency is key 
 - try for 1 problem a day
