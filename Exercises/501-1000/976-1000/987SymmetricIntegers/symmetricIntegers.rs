2843. Count Symmetric Integers
Easy
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given two positive integers low and high.

An integer x consisting of 2 * n digits is symmetric if the sum of the first n digits of x is equal to the sum of the last n digits of x. Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric.

Return the number of symmetric integers in the range [low, high].



Example 1:

Input: low = 1, high = 100
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 symmetric integers between 1 and 100: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.
Example 2:

Input: low = 1200, high = 1230
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 symmetric integers between 1200 and 1230: 1203, 1212, 1221, and 1230.


Constraints:

1 <= low <= high <= 104
