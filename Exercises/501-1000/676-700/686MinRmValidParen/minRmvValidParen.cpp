Hint
Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:

It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.


Example 1:

Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"
Example 3:

Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either'(' , ')', or lowercase English letter.
