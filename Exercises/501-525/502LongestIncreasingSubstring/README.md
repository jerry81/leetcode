yes it kicked my ass.

for the subsequence problem, it's not always a knapsack.
sometimes the straightfoward recursion + dp solution gets wonky (i had a similar experience last year)

here, he did a iteration on increasing substrings to build the bottom up dp

it could be done backwards also i suppose, which was what i was going for

The binary search would have been overkill, as we just iterate all the elements here anyway
